                                    <p>A number of papers report achieving SOTA results by using vanilla SGD (or SGD + momentum) in contrast to using more refined optimisers like Adam. This gain in performance is often the result of lots of tweaking to determine the best moments to lower the learning rate. This article presents an admittedly super simple idea to automatically determine when this should be done. The idea is to model the slope of the loss curve (either training or validation) by a random variable and compute the probability that this slope is actually negative. This can be challenging as the loss across mini-batches is often hardly consistent. Look at the plots given in the blog post. This simple modelisation is able to detect very subtle variations in the slope.</p>

You can choose from a variety of optimisation algorithms, choose their hyperparameters, choose a loss landscape and see how it behaves both in 2D and 3D!! (the case of 2D corresponds to the usual loss curve we see in Tensorboard).</p>

                     <p class="quote">UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is a novel manifold learning technique for dimension reduction. UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP as described has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.</p>

                                    <p>This dimentionality reduction method looks very interesting. It produces interesting visualisations and is reportedly faster than t-SNE (up to 100 times faster) and multicore t-SNE (up to 10 times faster) for large datasets.</p>

Their assessment is that the community promotes wins rather than research (see the quote below) which hampers pace of meaningful discoveries. I was a bit disapointed at first because this observation is hardly backed up by facts. However page 3 is extremely refreshing. They propose tons of positive ideas on how to write consistent and rigorous papers; consider alternative medium to publish research such as notebooks, videos etc.; suggest that *all* experiments performed when doing research should be stored in an electronic doc (...Sacred!...), promotes collaboration as it's done in physics...</p>

They propose a new mathematical notation (haven't checked that yet) and an implementation example for evolutionary search. So it could eventually become an alternative to CuDNN;...

This man may have the solution.<br/>On a more serious note, the concern is real. People replying to the tweet have linked nice suggestions such as <a href=http://labs.semanticscholar.org/citeomatic/>Citeomatic</a>.</p>

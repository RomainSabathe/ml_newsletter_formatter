                  <p>A new post from Distill and as usual it's a fantastic piece of work. Lots of visualisations and Javascript snippets to play with. Authors advocate that current approaches to deep net interpretability need to converge somehow. For instance, saliency maps are not enough. Usually interpretation is done by comparing the outputs and feature maps to the input image. Here the idea is to directly explore the concepts learned by the network (via its feature maps) by slicing the hypercube of layers+feature maps in all possible ways. In the end they are trying to achieve an interface for easier interpretability.</p>

                                                    Off the convex path - Nadav Cohen
                  </h6>
                  <p>Nadav Cohen shares the ideas and discoveries from his recent paper <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06509.pdf>On the Optimization of Deep Networks: Implicit Accelration by Overparameterization</a>. He and his collegues show that in the setting of regression task, setting the loss function to <i>Lp</i> with <i>p>2</i> (usually we use <i>p=2</i>) and overparametrizing the network lead to an interesting dynamic of SGD whereby it exhibits a sort of implicit momentum. On toy problems they show that it outperforms (by almost an order of magnitude!) Adadelta and Adagrad. They also theoretically show that this behavior cannot be obtained by performing 'tricks' on SGD a la Adalta, Adagrad etc. You could think this result is obvious since they overparametrized the network... but this result was actually obtained on linear models where adding more layers does not increase the expressiveness of the model. <br /> For some reason, their result seem to be valid on MNIST as well.</p>

But while MAML unrolls and differentiates through the computation graph of the gradient descent algorithm, Reptile simply performs stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on each task in a standard way — it does not unroll a computation graph or calculate any second derivatives. This makes Reptile take less computation and memory than MAML.</p>

We propose to mitigate this phenomenon with a principled importance sampling scheme that focuses computation on 'informative' examples, and reduces the variance of the stochastic gradients during training. [...]  We demonstrate experimentally, on image classification, CNN fine-tuning, and RNN training, that for a fixed wall-clock time budget, it provides a reduction of the train losses of up to an order of magnitude and a relative improvement of test errors between 5% and 17%.</p>

Specifically we study the DNN loss surface along the trajectory of SGD by interpolating the loss surface between parameters from consecutive iterations and tracking various metrics during the training process. [...] Specifically, our experiments show evidence that for the most part of training, SGD explores regions along a valley by bouncing off valley walls at a height above the valley floor. This 'bouncing off walls at a height' mechanism helps SGD traverse larger distance for small batch sizes and large learning rates which we find play qualitatively different roles in the dynamics.</p>

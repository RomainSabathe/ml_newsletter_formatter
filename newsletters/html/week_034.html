                                    <p>The whole field of machine learning is exploring more and more the properties of optimal transport as an alternative to Kullback-Leibler divergence. This post is a short but clear and interesting introduction to optimal transport. The author offers different views (from intuition to discrete formulation and continuous formulation). The <a href=https://www.mindcodec.com/an-intuitive-guide-to-optimal-transport-part-ii-the-wasserstein-gan-made-easy/>second part</a> deals more specifically with a highlight of last year: the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875>Wasserstein GAN</a>. On the same subject, you can also find a recent application of optimal transport to NLP in the paper <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.09663>Wasserstein is all you need</a>. To go even further, check out the  workshop presented at NIPS 2017, <a href=https://vimeo.com/248504509>A Primer on Optimal Transport</a> by Cuturi and Solomon. </p>

                                    <p>This blog post offers a rather entertaining demo that you can find <a href=http://www.bayeswatch.com/assets/ginn/good3.html>here</a>. A shallow fully-connected ReLU-activated network is trained to output a fixed predefined shape. The demo lets you see how the decision frontier of the different ReLU units evolve over time. As the post indicates, we can observe how it is the biases which are mainly modified in the first iterations and how deeper layers build a more comprehensive representation of the image.</p>

                                    <p>A few weeks ago, we shared a <a href=https://kasparmartens.rbind.io/post/np/>blog post</a> giving an introduction to one of DeepMind's latest work: neural processes. The goal of this technique is to model a distribution of <i>functions</i> (rather than a distribution of vectors) and to use neural networks to do so. In other words, it can be seen as the 'deep learning' equivalent to gaussian processes. This blog post offers a more hands-on view as code is made available to create neural processes. </p>

                                    <p>One can be surprised to notice that there is still no common, unified way of graphically representing neural networks in papers. We could argue that the diversity of architectures can't be represented though a unique type of visualisation. While this blog post does not offer an explicit solution, its author does a great job at going over different types of visualisations that have been tested in the past, while highlighting their respective strenghts and weaknesses. I particularly liked the end of the post where you will find a list of tools that can help you build a good visualisation of your architecture. </p>

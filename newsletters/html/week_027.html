He first offers a detailed reminder of the fundation of statistical tests (null hypothesis, p-value, t-test etc.). He then studies two tests commonly used (namely the Welch's t-test and the bootstraped confidence intervals) and, using examples, gives advises as to when to use one or the other. The examples he uses are quite interesting,...and surprising! </p>

                  <p>Researchers train a CNN to take as input a black image with one single white pixel and to output the coordinate of the pixel. They observe that the model couldn't properly solve this task (the test performance was always below a significant threshold). The reverse problem (from pixel coordinate to generating an image) couldn't be solved either. They propose a fix called CoordConv which simply consists in adding two feature maps encoding the (x, y) location of the pixels. They argue that, although this breaks CNN's equivariance and therefore appear counterintuitive, the number of added parameters remains low. It's just a few added kernels for these 2 new feature maps and the network might as well decide to set their corresponding weights to zero. They test their method on common deep-learning problems. They observe improvements in object detection and reinforcement learning (where an agent has to move in a maze for instance). Interestingly, they observe <i>microscopic</i> improvement on image classification which is reassuring as CoordConv did not degrade the performance.<br />In any case, I recommend watching the associated video <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=8yFQc6elePA>here</a>. They do a great job at explaining their work and it's even fun to watch.</p>

                     <p class="quote">Modern Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are extremely powerful on a range of computer vision tasks. However, their performance may degrade when the data is characterised by large intra-class variability caused by spatial transformations. The Spatial Transformer Network (STN) is currently the method of choice for providing CNNs the ability to remove those transformations and improve performance in an end-to-end learning framework. In this paper, we propose Densely Fused Spatial Transformer Network (DeSTNet), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first dense fusion pattern for combining multiple STNs. Specifically, we show how changing the connectivity pattern of multiple STNs from sequential to dense leads to more powerful alignment modules. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks namely, MNIST, GTSRB, and IDocDB show that the proposed technique outperforms related state-of-the-art methods (i.e., STNs and CSTNs) both in terms of accuracy and robustness.</p>

                  <p>A statement that GANs and VAEs are not the only models to propose solid image generation capabilities! Here they explore a new type of <i>flow-based generative model</i> called Glow. From my limited understanding, flow-based generative models have some of the advantages of VAEs (where the input distribution is continuously mapped on a latent distribution) but at the same time offer exact latent-variable inference. This allows exact inference and therefore probably faster trainings. In particular, in this work, they trained their Glow model on an unlabeled set of face images. Once it has been trained, they were able to find the latent directions corresponding to expected characteristics of the dataset (age, sex, smile...) allowing them to move along those directions even though they never explicitely appeared in training! Admittedly the main contribution of this paper is an architecture improvement over an older flow-based generative model called <i>RealNVP</i>. In particular, authors introduce reversible 1x1 convolutions.</p>

                  <p>In a white-box setting, a popular defense strategy is to use <i>gradient masking</i> where the model learns to not provide useful gradient information, hence making useless any attack relying on the latter gradients. Authors observe that this defense strategy is so popular that it was used 7 times at ICLR 2018. Yet, by carefully analysing each of them, authors managed to overcome them and by doing so proved that gradient masking is not a failsafe defense yet.</p>

                     <p class="quote">We identify obfuscated gradients, a kind of gradient masking, as a phenomenon that leads to a false sense of security in defenses against adversarial examples. While defenses that cause obfuscated gradients appear to defeat iterative optimization-based attacks, we find defenses relying on this effect can be circumvented. We describe characteristic behaviors of defenses exhibiting the effect, and for each of the three types of obfuscated gradients we discover, we develop attack techniques to overcome it.</p>

                  <p>Some weeks ago, a library built on top on Pandas called <i>Pandas on Ray</i> was released. The novelty was the ability to distribute the computation performed on the dataframe. In this post, authors draw some first observations based on people's feedback. They are also announcing that future versions of Pandas on Ray will use both the benefit of eager and lazy execution.</p>

                  <p>This article (or paper) presented for the ICML Machine Learning Debates workshop explores some of the critics that are often being made to published papers and reviewers of the ML community over the last few years. Those critics typically condemn unhealthy research in the form of <i>mathiness</i> (over-complicating equations for the sake of looking convincing), misuse of language, over-speculation to the detriment of proper explanation or unability to precisely identify the source of gain from a proposed method (is it due to the architecture, or to a better hyperparameter tuning?). In this article, authors cite a variety of works (with big names), some of them being examples of good practices and others of bad practices. As demonstration of goodwill, they often include themselves in this latter category.</p>

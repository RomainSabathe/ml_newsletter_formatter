                                    <p>If you are still wondering what probabilistic programming is, here's your change to catch up in just about 15 minutes. The author shows how to use Pyro, a probabilistic programming 'add-on' built on top of Pytorch to create a network whose each individual weight is sampled from a parametrized distribution (instead of being a fixed float). The network is trained to classify MNIST digits. Not so exciting; except that we are now able to precisely measure the uncertainty of the model. What I really liked with this article is the many resources that the author provide throughout. For instance: the <a href=http://pyro.ai/examples/intro_part_i.html#>Pyro tutorial</a>, an <a href=https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/11/pyro-wml/>IBM article</a> on probabilistic programming, this <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=DYRK0-_K2UU>ICML 2018 tutorial on variational bayes</a>.

                                    <p>Solving protein folding is, as everyone knows, a huge challenge. The gist of the problem is: given the DNA sequence that 'encodes' the protein, what will the 3d shape of the protein be? DeepMind has been working on that problem for just about two years, but has already built a system that is state-of-the-art in protein structure predictions. To do this, they trained a few deep nets to predict the distance or the angle (in terms of chemical bonds) between pairs of amino acids in the final protein. Other nets were responsible to aggregate all the distance predictions to either estimate the accuracy of the proposed protein or how close it is to the actual 3d structure. The scores were then 'simply' optimized via gradient descent!<br />Related to this topic, the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal, University of Montreal and the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute submitted a <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06128>manuscript</a> last month on machine learning for combinatorial optimization.</p>

                                    <p>This paper published at NeurIPS 2018 explores the reasons of batch normalization's success. Interestingly, authors find it has probably nothing to do with internal covariate shift. Rather, batch norm would help smoothing the optimization landscape (they prove that the Lipschitz coefficient gets smaller when batch norm is used).

                                    <p>We already talked about <a href=https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops>einops</a> a few weeks ago. This library lets you reshape and aggregate tensors by explicitly defining the input shape and the expected output shape. Here, a 'tensor' is a general term as einops supports many libraries, including the now standards numpy, tensorflow and pytorch. I already started using it and it's extremely powerful. Check <a href=https://github.com/arogozhnikov/einops/blob/master/docs/1-einops-basics.ipynb>these examples</a> for instance. Anyways, in this post, einops' author has combined a list of common deep learning architectures (conv net, recurrent model, style-transfer, ResNet, Tacotron, transformer, spatial transformer networks,...) in a side-by-side comparison. On the left: the code that doesn't use einops. On the right: the code that uses einops. As expected, the code on the right is shorter and arguably cleaner than code on the left. This is obtained by an extensive use of Pytorch's <i>Sequential</i> module and less comments, since the shapes are already written down in einops' functions.</p>

We explore how using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing structured behaviors.</p>

Basically the problem is: can we design a way to 1) encode all possible data augmentation procedures, without having to manually code them individually, and 2) given a dataset and a neural network, find the optimal set of augmentations such that we maximise the network's generalization performance? This blog post is an introduction to the full paper <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.09501>here</a>. We learn that they used reinforcement learning to find these optimal augmentations. So cool!</p>

                                    <p>Authors tackle the problem of <i>test set overfitting</i> on CIFAR-10. The question is following: the CIFAR-10 test set has been optimised on for 10 years and used as criterion when we compare the performance of models. Do these models truly generalise or are they optimised for the test set? To answer this question, authors have created a new test set of truly unseen images and designed it so its distribution is close from the original CIFAR-10 test set. They test tens of models (and different implementations) on this new test set and the results are quite striking.<br /> There are two main observations: the first one is that there is indeed a performance drop from the original test set to the new one (up to 15% accuracy) and this observation holds across <i>all</i> the models they tested. However, they observe a surprising trend by which the best models on the original test set remain the best models on the new test set. They actually note that there is a linear relationship like: new_perf = a*old_perf + b (with b < 0). Their conclusion is that although this apparent overfitting may be concerning, using a same test set and optimising for it over 10 years has not been detrimental (in terms of evaluation of machine learning models).</p>

                                    <p>Quite an interesting read. The author experiments a variation of SGD in which the gradients are normalised (by L2 or L-infinity) to avoid what he calls a double-scalling effect (one that comes from the learning rate, the other from the norm of the gradient vector). If I am not mistakken, this idea was also cental in the awarded paper 'On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond', reviewed by Blanca. Here, the author provides <a href=https://github.com/kmkolasinski/deep-learning-notes/blob/master/max-normed-optimizer/notes.pdf>notes</a> and details his motivations. Interestingly, he ends up using SGD on the learning rate (as was done in some other paper, see <a href=https://medium.com/onfido-tech/towards-faster-training-and-smaller-generalisation-gaps-in-deep-learning-b9767f68ec23>here</a> for an overview ;-)). On MNIST and CIFAR, this methods yields same-or-better results compared to Adam but more importantly: training is smoother and relies less on the initial learning rate. The webpage provides links to additional papers for further reading.</p>

                                    <p>Quite interesting. The author presents scenarios where given some a priori knowledge on the problem, we can discard the need to specify a loss function. This is achieved by explicitely computing the gradient values for the last layer, and using backprop from there. I doubt this is used a lot in practice though, as it requires that you know the type of label distribution (for instance, in case of regression: Gaussian, Poisson, etc.).</p>

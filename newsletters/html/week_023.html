                  <p>DeepMind keeps bringing some insane stuff. Imagine a 3d-rendered scene (with a ball and a square placed somewhere on the ground) and take two pictures of this scene, from different viewpoints. Give these images to an agent. And now query the agent by asking it <i>to generate the image corresponding to a novel viewpoint</i>. That's exactly what this paper is all about. From a limited number of viewpoints, the agent learns a representation of the scene, such that it is virtually (or <i>mentally</i>) able to move around in the scene. By doing so, it implies the agent has learned relationship between objects (distances, shapes, colors) as well as physical/optical properties of the world (occllusions, illumination, shadows). Highly recommend to check out the article as well as the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-kWNQJ4idw&feature=youtu.be>presentation video</a>. It's breathtaking!!</p>

                  <p>Authors make the quite shocking observation that modern deep learning architectures are NOT invariant to translation. They explain that this is due to the <i>subsampling</i> operation (generally called <i>stride</i> with CNNs) which is often greater than 1 in modern deep net architectures; besides not being coupled with a pooling operation. As a result, the neural network is not invariant to <i>any</i> translation, but by translations which are multiples of the overall stide. In essence, this means that by shifthing an image by just 1 pixel can result in a completely different network output.</p>

                  <p>The novelty of this paper is that it proposes a single model to multiple multiple types of image-to-image translation (i.e. transfer to different domains). Being able to handle multiple domains has been a challenge or a while with GANs. The immediate benefit is that training can be done using multiple types of datasets; in the paper, the example presented is one dataset for gender/hair color and the other for facial emotion. An implemenation is given <a href=https://github.com/taki0112/StarGAN-Tensorflow>here</a>.</p>

                  <p>In this article, authors explain how they significatively improved performance over SOTA on a variety of NLP benchmarks. Interestingly, the key is not a better model or a clever trick but rather a better initialization. More precisely, 8 GPUs worked for a month on a very large corpus of texts to train a model in an unsupervised manner. Fine tuning from there leads to impressive improvement compared to training from a random initialization (~+55% relative performance for question answering, for example). I particularly liked that they were open and direct on the drawbacks of their method as well as the remaining open questions. <br /> Hey, know what? I started mentioning this article at the beginning of the week. And by Friday, we already have some open-source implementations available: <a href=https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-openai-transformer-lm>here</a>.</p>

                  <p>I really love the intersection between ML and arts. Here, a process called Computational Pattern Producing networks is used to generate abstract color images from a randomly initialised neural network. The idea seems extremely simple: we give a network some coordinates (x, y) and it outputs 3 values (r, g, b) (or similar for another color-encoding scheme) which we can display as an image. The Computational Pattern Producing pattern appears to be an iterative process whereby the produced image gets refined and sharpened in several steps. The results are quite surprising I have to say. A great source for psychedelic visuals. :) The author uses Tensorflow JS so you can create your own visuals directly in-the-browser. Additional links are included if you want to learn more about Computation Pattern Producing Networks.</p>

                                    <p>This post is actually the third chapter of this series. In this one, the author creates a stress test script to test the scalability of his server. The script sends one request every 0.05 seconds for 25 seconds (that's 500 requests). The post features a Youtube video where the stress test is being executed... and it works! The caveat: it's running on GPUs. Although there's something interesting: from what I understood, the queue manager is able to pick up several images at a time and pack them into a batch. So instead of processing images per request, the model can process several requests at the same time. Have to check how it's properly being done but... Pretty clever.</p>

SAC-X is based on the idea that to learn complex tasks from scratch, an agent has to learn to explore and master a set of basic skills first. Just as a baby must develop coordination and balance before she crawls or walks—providing an agent with internal (auxiliary) goals corresponding to simple skills increases the chance it can understand and perform more complicated tasks.</p>

Thus, an extra process is needed to prepare data in specific formats. In addition, their losses are obtained from a limited number of samples, which leads to a lack of the global view of the embedding space. In this paper, we replace the Euclidean distance with the cosine similarity to better utilize the L2-normalization, which is able to attenuate the curse of dimensionality.</p>

What sticked to my mind was: the space of training data is huge (infinite number of states, infinite number of actions, both supposedly to be visited an inifinite amount of times); training is often slow and inefficient due to the weaknesses of gradient descent; unlike supervised learning the 'labels' can change over time (a same state can have different rewards); extreme dependence on initial conditions and hyperparameters since the training data is built by the agent  exploring the search space. Hierarchical RL is described at the end and presented as a potential solution to these problems. Actually it seems to be a hot topic (see the Deep Mind paper just below).</p>

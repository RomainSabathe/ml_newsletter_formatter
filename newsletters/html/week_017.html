                  </blockquote>
                                    <p>A student from fast.ai achieved training a model on ImageNet up to 93% accuracy in a very short amount of time and at a reduced cost (notebook <a href=https://github.com/radekosmulski/machine_learning_notebooks/blob/master/cifar10_fastai_dawnbench.ipynb>here</a>). This blog post explains the method they followed. It seems they relied on the phenomenon of <i>super convergence</i> apparently discovered last year where the learning rate is gradually increased while the momentum is gradually lowered. They used half-precision floats as well as a technique inspired by <i>Progressive Growing of GANs</i> (discussed by Joao in our paper reading group). They started training the network on small images and increased the size of the input images along training. To make this possible they made use of 'adaptative pooling'. <br />The whole blog post is also a lampoon against the race to more computing power and more data. Jeremy Howard (founder of fast.ai and author of the post) obviously promotes the creativity and awesomeness of his class.... </p>

                                    <p>Remember last week we linked a work from Uber where they explored a so-called 'Intrinsic Dimension' of neural networks? These were empirical observations stating that a good minima of the loss function lied in a subspace of lower dimension. If you have 1000 parameters (therefore the loss function is 1000-dimentional), it could well be that that a minima can be found by solely exploring a subspace of only 200 dimensions. Although I haven't read the paper linked here, I feel like the abstract describes exactly this observation. The author attempts to provide a theoretical explanation.</p>

Conditional generation enables interactive control, but creating new controls often requires expensive retraining. In this paper, we develop a method to condition generation without retraining the model. By post-hoc learning latent constraints, value functions that identify regions in latent space that generate outputs with desired attributes, we can conditionally sample from these regions with gradient-based optimization or amortized actor functions.</p>

                                    <p>Did you know that the Einstein summation was supported in Numpy, Tensorflow and Pytorch? This blog post explains how to use it and how it can make complex matrix multiplications super easy; especially when it involves convoluted shapes and batch dimensions. Tons of examples are provided. Some people has been questionning the speed efficiency of <i>einsum</i> functions though.</p>

                                    <p>Very exciting news for PyTorch. Engineers are targeting to release PyTorch 1.0 this summer. It will be 'production-ready'. This doesn't only mean that the library needs to be stable, it also needs to be scalable, low-level optimised and deployable on several architectures. The post explains the design decisions that have been taken to get there. I'm pleased to see engineers are doing their best to offer both the best of the flexibility of PyTorch and the rigidity of an optimised ML code. TO this end they will release a Just In Time compiler. It will dynamically analyse the Python code and generate and underlying C++ optimised code for faster computation.</p>

                  <p>You probably have heard of <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05770>Normalizing Flow</a>, a class of variational inference models which is able to model complex densities by applying a sequence of invertible transformations to a simple initial density, like a Gaussian. This has the potential to alleviate some of the issues of variational autoencoders, such as a rather weak prior (unimodal Gaussian). This post is a rather short introduction to normalizing flows; it introduces two invertible transformations: the planar flow and radial flow. In an example, the author shows how this is enough to convert a simple Gaussian into a multimodal distribution. If you want to learn more about flow-based models, have a look at <a href=https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/10/13/flow-based-deep-generative-models.html>this post</a> published by Lilian Weng last month. We mentioned it in a previous newsletter. :-)</p>

We talked a few times already about this difficult Atari game which stayed unsolved for a few years (even when using deep reinforcement learning). About five months ago, OpenAI used <a href=https://blog.openai.com/learning-montezumas-revenge-from-a-single-demonstration/>a single human demonstration</a> to obtain an impressive score. More recently, a few weeks ago, we talked about <a href=https://blog.openai.com/reinforcement-learning-with-prediction-based-rewards/>Random Network Distillation</a>, a curiosity-driven appproach that was used by OpenAI to 'solve' the game without human assistance, reaching a score of about 10k. Well this record just got beaten by Uber, who obtained a score of about 35k points. This blog post describes their approach. The key is to encourage the agent to learn <i>how</i> to get back to a state it has already visited. From there, proper exploration can resume.</p>

                  <p>Looking for the latest implementation of a specific object-detection model? Or you'd like to use a pre-trained model for a task you are not too familiar with? Chances are ModelDepot will help you do that. In appearance, it's quite simple: it's a search engine for publicly available model implementations. It is not the first time we see that around, but I was overall impressed by the speed and the accuracy of the results.  There are some well-thought features such as the possibility to sort by GitHub stars or most recent commit.</p>

They gathered 2,000 hours of Youtube videos to train their model. Faces are detected first to extract video features. The audio features consist of a Fourier transform. Audio-Visual features are concatenated and passed to recurrent layers. The ouput is an audio mask that we can apply to the original audio stream. We'll get as many masks as there are of speakers (and depending on the training procedure). Applying the mask isolates the audio from one speaker to the other. The examples shown are super convincing!</p>

                                    <p>Just when I started to get used to (even bored??) by style transfer examples, this work brings a bit of fresh air. The idea is the following: you start from an existing image with a strong distinctive appearance (say a painting) and you paste on this image an element which has a completely different appearance (say a photo of a car). The goal is to modify the photo of the car so its appearance melts with the appearance of the painting, resulting in a unified painting with a car in it. The paper provides some interesting visuals but I also liked the examples provided in this <a href=https://github.com/luanfujun/deep-painterly-harmonization#examples>Github implementation</a>. Some of them are stunning. Could we use this to digitally tamper documents?</p>

                                    <p>The kind of idea that gets me excited. The goal is simple to formulate: they are trying to model the plasticity of the brain and to incorporate it in the standard deep learning framework with gradient descent. Their suggested solution is to extend the weights so that they have two components. The first one changes over time depending on the inputs (that's the plasticity part) while the second one is fixed over time and can be seen as a traditional weight. During training, a parameter is learned to determine which of the first or second component should be predominant. Ideally, this should produce a network which has at the same time fixed connections (ideal for learned tasks) and plastic connections (suitable for retraining and few-shot learning).</p>

                                    <p>This paper presents a reward functions and a few tricks to make an agent learn realistic movements from a single training sample. The reward function is (as they say) quite simple: it consists in minimizing the L2 distance between the current pose and the target pose and to do this over time. Among the tricks they used, they suggested to initialise the simulation at mid-course of the action. For instance, if you want to teach a backflip, you can initialise the simulation when the agent is in the air and needs to fall on the floor. This forces the exploration  of rewards that otherwise would never had been discovered if the agent had started on the floor. Also, they suggest that early termination (i.e. the action of stopping the simulation when it obviously failed) plays a determinant role. For example, back to the idea of backflip, if the agent fails to jump and land and the floor, we should terminate the simulation. Otherwise, the agent will try to do the movements of a backflip on the ground and will likely get some reward out of it. Next time, it'll be incentivized to do the movement directly on the floor.</p>

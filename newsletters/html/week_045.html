                  <p>Tensorflow Probability has been released earlier this year. It provides the traditional set of probabilistic programming tools inside the Tensorflow framework. This blog post is a tiny introduction of what TFP can do. More precisely, in this example authors estimate the probability that a certain component used on the Challenger space shuttle (1986) fails under certain temperatures. More generally, the post is here to announce that the very famous <a href=https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers>Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers</a> tutorial has been extended to include examples written using Tensorflow Probability. I'm also mentioning that the next major release of PyMC, one of the most famous probabilistic programming package for Python, will be using <a href=https://medium.com/@pymc_devs/theano-tensorflow-and-the-future-of-pymc-6c9987bb19d5>Tensorflow Probability</a> as its backend instead of Theano.</p>

                  <p>We already talked about <a href=https://github.com/google-research/bert>BERT</a> in a previous newsletter. This is a new method proposed by Google to pretrain language representations. It went popular very quickly as authors proved that one can achieve SOTA results on a number of different NLP-related tasks by finetuning the representations obtained with BERT. Similarly to what we would do in computer vision by finetuning a model trained on ImageNet (see a related article <a href=http://ruder.io/nlp-imagenet/>here</a> by Sebastian Ruder). If you want to learn more about BERT, this blog post could help you! All the concepts are explained in a visual-friendly approach.</p>

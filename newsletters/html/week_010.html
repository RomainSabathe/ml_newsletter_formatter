                                    <p>Nice repo if you're familiar with a specific DL framework and want some change. It's basically a collection of notebook. Each of them solves a specific problem (inference in a graph, training a CNN, training an RNN). And there's one notebook per deep learning framework! Allowing you to compare directly the ammount of code required to get a training running. The proposed frameworks are: CNTK, Caffe, Chainer, Gluon, Keras, Knet, MXNet, Pytorch, Tensorflow and Theano.<br/> The best part? The author provides benchmark on running times!! Annndddd Pytorch appears to be faster to train compared to Tensorflow, even on multi GPU configuration! However, Tensorflow is about 15% faster for inference on K80s.</p>

We introduce flipout, an efficient method for decorrelating the gradients within a mini-batch by implicitly sampling pseudo-independent weight perturbations for each example. Empirically, flipout achieves the ideal linear variance reduction for fully connected networks, convolutional networks, and RNNs.</p>

                                    <p>Magenta has released... a device! It is open source (that's awesome). It's a tactile board with 4 corners and an audio output. By moving your finger on the board, the device will produce a sound as a combination of 4 instruments (you can select those instruments). The closer your finger from a corner, the more obvious it will sound from a specific instrument. From a small chat I had at NIPS, it seems the underlying algorithm is based on a Variational Autoencoder. By defining 4 instruments, you can define an hyperplane in the embedding space and move along it. I imagine a tricky part is to produce a non-noisy sound from a given embedding...<br/>Edit Friday: here is a <a href=https://magenta.tensorflow.org/music-vae>blog post</a> explaining the theory behind it.

                     <p class="quote">We describe a new variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) called high-accuracy low precision (HALP) that can sometimes get high-accuracy solutions from low-precision training.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                                    <p>To get a good training, we need to use high precision numbers (encoded on at least 32 bits and more broadly on 64 bits). This blog post describes an idea which enables to use low precision numbers (on 8 bits for instance). The idea is to refine the range described by those 8 bits during training. During early training, the gradients will have a high value so the 8 bits must cover a high range of values (say from -5 to 5). But as training goes on, gradients become smaller and we can use those 8 bits to cover a narrower range of values (say from -0.1 to 0.1); hence preserving a decent amount of precision. The algorithm has theoretical grounds for strongly convex problems. </p>

They compared different feature-extraction architectures (VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, ShuffleNet) coupled with different decoding methods (UNet, SkipNet, Dilation...). The setting is essentially for a driving car; so road-like scenery segmentation. Oh, and the goal is to achieve real-time segmentation so MobileNet seems to obtain good scores.</p>

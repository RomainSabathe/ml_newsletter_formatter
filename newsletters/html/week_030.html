                  <p>This paper deals with the many uncertainties that we face when releasing models to production. Will the predictions be consistent? Will the model crash for some inputs? We can see there are at least two types of uncertainties: the first one is concerned with overfitting and the model's generalization capabilities while the second is linked to stability of the running code (numerical errors such as NaNs could make the code crash). While the former issue of overfitting is vastly explored in the litterature, the latter is often overlooked. In this work, authors take inspiration from code <i>fuzzing</i> where an algorithm is aggresively testing all possibilities of a code to find ways to make it crash (imagine testing all if/else branch combinations for instance). They define what <i>fuzzing</i> would mean for the activations of a neural network and show in some toy experiments that their algorithm is able to find numerical errors and inconsistencies on a trained network.</p>

                  <p>Over the last year, the landscape of recurrent neural networks has started to shift, particularly after the introduction of the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>Transformer</a> and of <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122>convolutional sequence-to-sequence models</a>. This blog post comes as an introduction to these changes. It explains why complex feed-forward models are gaining more and more attraction for tasks usually handled by recurrent models. The post also serves as an opening for the paper published by the author: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10369>When Recurrent Models Don't Need to be Recurrent</a>.</p>

                  <p>This work has received a lot of attention in the community lately. The reason is quite simple: they obtained close-to state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet in less than 10 minutes. Less than 7 minutes even! A year ago, the fastest we could do was <a ref=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677>in about an hour</a>. The paper proposes multiple innovations that made this possible. In particular, they were able to scale up the batch size and yet achieve consistent training (from a batch size of 8,192 in the previous work to 64,000 here). At the same time, the number of GPUs also scaled up... from 256 to 1,024 and even 2,048!</p>

                  <p>Researchers built a physical optical system mimicking an artificial neural network that is able to perform classification based on light sources. A quite promising concept although commentators pointed out that this setup doesn't incorporate any non-linearities... yet?</p>

We introduce a physical mechanism to perform machine learning by demonstrating an all-optical Diffractive Deep Neural Network (D2NN) architecture that can implement various functions following the deep learning-based design of passive diffractive layers that work collectively. [...] Our all-optical deep learning framework can perform, at the speed of light [...]</p>

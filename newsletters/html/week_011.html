                  <p>A thorough study of the performance of Pandas vs Numpy in diverse scenario. The author shares a Benchmark class that he used as well as the conclusions of this investigation. And it's quite a mess. For instance, you should use df.sum() instead of np.sum(). But for sorting, you better use np.sort() instead of df.sort_item() (the difference is huge, up to 5x...). Interesting read if you want to optimise your data processing performance. </p>

                     <p class="quote">While training error of most deep neural networks degrades as the depth of the network increases, residual networks appear to be an exception. We show that the main reason for this is the Lyapunov stability of the gradient descent algorithm: for an arbitrarily chosen step size, the equilibria of the gradient descent are most likely to remain stable for the parametrization of residual networks.</p>

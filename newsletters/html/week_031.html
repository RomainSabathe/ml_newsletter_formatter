Helix minimizes the runtime per iteration via program analysis and intelligent reuse of previous results, which are selectively materialized -- trading off the cost of materialization for potential future benefits -- to speed up future iterations. Additionally, Helix offers a graphical interface to visualize workflow DAGs and compare versions to facilitate iterative development.</p>

                  <p>This is a 'work in progress' version of an online book that I am personally eager to read in more depth. The approach is quite different from a traditional textbook that goes <i>depth first</i>, exploring the ultimate details of specific topics, one after the other. Here it appears to be more <i>horizontal</i> by discussing problem cases and going over the different tools one can use to solve them. I found the explanations extremely clear, which makes me think this book will become a great read for beginners.</p>

                  <p>In this very exciting project, the company Primer aims to find people of importance who are lacking their dedicated Wikipedia page. For now the project focuses on people from the computer science field. In the blog post, they explain how they trained a network to digest large quantities of news articles and to cross-reference them to identify recurring names. The system is then able to generate sentences describing a summary of the findings and to link to the sources! In short, it is able to identify potentially missing pages from Wikipedia and to generate a draft for such a page. You can see what it generated for <a href=https://quicksilver.primer.ai/andrej_karpathy/>Andrej Karpathy</a>. Did you know one of his hobbies was to solve Rubik's cubes?</p>

                  <p>What is meaning? The most striking successes of recent NLP seem to relate to <i>language models</i> where the mecanism of creating a word or a sentence seems to be decoupled from its meaning. In this post, Mr. Wolf summaries a large discussion that has happened on Twitter on this topic. He identifies the sub-discussions and the themes that were explored. This serves as a great introduction to understand a little better the landscape of NLP and the challenges to come.</p>

Sacred is a tool for tracking and monitoring experiments. On multiple occasions, I found it extremely useful to retrieve the parameters I have used for previous experiments but also to compare the results of different experiments. For the latter use-case, it is a bit more limited as it lets you only record scalar values and you have to write a custom script to be able to compare results across experiments. <i>ml_board</i> appears to be an interesting alternative to improve performance tracking in particular. The GUI integrates multiple types of metrics and natively lets you compare the results of different experiment. Will definitively give it a try!</p>

                  <p>The authors (and their institution) of every single paper published at NIPS 2017 were analysed to draw publication statistics. Some facts were not so surprising; for instance the United States is the first country in terms of <i>publication index</i>, both in industry (with Google and Microsoft leading the way) and in acamedia (with CMU, MIT and Standord University in top positions). However what can be surprising is the scale of US predominance, even when combining countries from the European Union and Switzerland. One criticism I would make is that DeepMind seems to have been categorised as a US company.</p>

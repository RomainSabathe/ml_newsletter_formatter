    description: 'Yet another great post from Sudharshan Chandra Babu who already
      wrote about <a href=https://blog.nanonets.com/human-pose-estimation-2d-guide/>2D
      pose estimation</a> last month. The format is similar: it is a paper-by-paper
      survey of some of the latest and most popular works on 3D pose estimation.'

    description: 'This short post is an introduction to a method that represents tensors
      in any dimension and their associated operations by using graphs. The graphs
      are then called Tensor Network Diagrams (or <i>string diagrams</i> depending
      on your field...). I love this kind of simple yet neat idea. The author presents
      a few potential applications: a visual representation of SVD and a ''proof''
      that trace is invariant to cyclic permutations. You should check out the rest
      of the author''s website, there are a ton of interesting articles.'

    quote: "[...] <b>We demonstrate that adversarial examples can be directly attributed\
      \ to the presence of non-robust features</b>: features derived from patterns\
      \ in the data distribution that are highly predictive, yet brittle and incomprehensible\
      \ to humans. After capturing these features within a theoretical framework,\
      \ we establish their widespread existence in standard datasets. Finally, <b>we\
      \ present a simple setting where we can rigorously tie the phenomena we observe\
      \ in practice to a misalignment between the (human-specified) notion of robustness\
      \ and the inherent geometry of the data.</b>"

    quote: "[...] In this paper, we find that [...] the test accuracy is a quadratic\
      \ function of the noise ratio in the case of symmetric noise, which explains\
      \ the experimental findings previously published. Based on our analysis, we\
      \ apply cross-validation to randomly split noisy datasets, which identifies\
      \ most samples that have correct labels. Then we adopt the Co-teaching strategy\
      \ which takes full advantage of the identified samples to train DNNs robustly\
      \ against noisy labels. [...]."

    quote: "[...]. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics\
      \ under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we\
      \ would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews\
      \ 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning\
      \ over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics\
      \ have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history,\
      \ detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection\
      \ system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods.\
      \ This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian\
      \ detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis\
      \ of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years."

    description: 'If the now classic and stunning <a href=https://david-abel.github.io/notes/iclr_2019.pdf>notes
      from David Abel</a> are too much to handle, then you will like this summary
      of ICLR 2019. There is a fair selection of works on unsupervised learning, reinforcement
      learning and bio-inspired deep learning. The author''s good understanding of
      the field makes it easier to understand where the community is heading towards
      (model-based reinforcement learning; meta-learning for unsupervised tasks; RNNs
      being less attractive compared to the <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762>Transformer</a>,
      etc.).'

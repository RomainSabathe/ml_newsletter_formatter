      description: "If you ever had a five minutes conversation with me, you would know that I am a big fan of Pink Floyd, but also that I absolutely love <a href=https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred>Sacred</a>. Sacred is a tool for tracking and monitoring experiments. On multiple occasions, I found it extremely useful to retrieve the parameters I have used for previous experiments but also to compare the results of different experiments. For the latter use-case, it is a bit more limited as it lets you only record scalar values and you have to write a custom script to be able to compare results across experiments. <i>ml_board</i> appears to be an interesting alternative to improve performance tracking in particular. The GUI integrates multiple types of metrics and natively lets you compare the results of different experiment. Will definitively give it a try!"

      description: "<i>The</i> big show of the last weekend. Will a team of bots be able to beat profesionnal players on a real-life complex strategy game? Yes, 2 out of 3 times. Note however that for this third game, the AI was constrainted in its choice of heroes, which can be seen as a sort of handicap. Congrats to OpenAI! The blog post also features some super interesting videos that show what is happening behind the scenes. My <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiyUSI-TEgo>favorite</a> depicts problems researchers faced when working on this awesome project."

      description: "The authors (and their institution) of every single paper published at NIPS 2017 were analysed to draw publication statistics. Some facts were not so surprising; for instance the United States is the first country in terms of <i>publication index</i>, both in industry (with Google and Microsoft leading the way) and in acamedia (with CMU, MIT and Standord University in top positions). However what can be surprising is the scale of US predominance, even when combining countries from the European Union and Switzerland. One criticism I would make is that DeepMind seems to have been categorised as a US company."

      description: "In this very exciting project, the company Primer aims to find people of importance who are lacking their dedicated Wikipedia page. For now the project focuses on people from the computer science field. In the blog post, they explain how they trained a network to digest large quantities of news articles and to cross-reference them to identify recurring names. The system is then able to generate sentences describing a summary of the findings and to link to the sources! In short, it is able to identify potentially missing pages from Wikipedia and to generate a draft for such a page. You can see what it generated for <a href=https://quicksilver.primer.ai/andrej_karpathy/>Andrej Karpathy</a>. Did you know one of his hobbies was to solve Rubik's cubes?"

      quote: "We propose Helix, a declarative machine learning system that accelerates iterative development by optimizing workflow execution end-to-end and across iterations. Helix minimizes the runtime per iteration via program analysis and intelligent reuse of previous results, which are selectively materialized -- trading off the cost of materialization for potential future benefits -- to speed up future iterations. Additionally, Helix offers a graphical interface to visualize workflow DAGs and compare versions to facilitate iterative development."

      lab: "Thomas Wolf"
      description: "What is meaning? The most striking successes of recent NLP seem to relate to <i>language models</i> where the mecanism of creating a word or a sentence seems to be decoupled from its meaning. In this post, Mr. Wolf summaries a large discussion that has happened on Twitter on this topic. He identifies the sub-discussions and the themes that were explored. This serves as a great introduction to understand a little better the landscape of NLP and the challenges to come."

      lab: "John Winn, Christopher Bishop, Thomas Diethe"
      description: "This is a 'work in progress' version of an online book that I am personally eager to read in more depth. The approach is quite different from a traditional textbook that goes <i>depth first</i>, exploring the ultimate details of specific topics, one after the other. Here it appears to be more <i>horizontal</i> by discussing problem cases and going over the different tools one can use to solve them. I found the explanations extremely clear, which makes me think this book will become a great read for beginners."

      description: "The title of the project is self-explanatory. The author goes over a sign-language recognition project and provides design decisions along the way. I particularly liked how he analysed the problem and was able to use Tensorflow.js as a tool to go from idea to prototyping in a short amount of time."

      description: "Which equation links currency arbitrage, deep Q-learning and light transport? In this enlighted (and enlightning) blog post, Mr. Jang revisits three problems that look distant at first, and put them under the common scope of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. The section on reinforcement learning in particular could very well serve as an introduction on post-2017 advances in Q-learning."

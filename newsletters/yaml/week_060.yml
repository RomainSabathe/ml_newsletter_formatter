    description: 'Vincent Vanhoucke mentions the common disappointment that people
      face when trying out semi-supervised learning. Only to reveal near the end the
      post that the struggle might be over. He mentions two important works on the
      subject published recently: <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02249>MixMatch</a>
      and <a href=1904.12848>Unsupervised Data Augmentation</a>, which we talked about
      in a previous issue. <br/> Note: I use a Twitter link as it avoids being blocked
      by Medium''s paywall.'

    description: 'This probably can be probably be helpful to some, as it essentially
      rewrites different components seen in other more specialised libraries (<a href=https://github.com/pytorch/ignite>Ignite</a>
      for the Keras-like approach to model compilation, <a href=https://github.com/albu/albumentations>Albumentations</a>
      for data augmentation and this <a href=https://github.com/Cadene/pretrained-models.pytorch>repo</a>
      for model zoo).'

    quote: 'Pywick is a high-level Pytorch training framework that aims to get you
      up and running quickly with state of the art neural networks. [...] Pywick tries
      to stay on the bleeding edge of research into neural networks. If you just wish
      to run a vanilla CNN, this is probably going to be overkill. However, if you
      want to get lost in the world of neural networks, fine-tuning and hyperparameter
      optimization for months on end then this is probably the right place for you
      :)'

    quote: "[...] In order to create a personalized talking head model, [traditional\
      \ methods] require training on a large dataset of images of a single person.\
      \ [...] Here, we present a system with such few-shot capability. It performs\
      \ lengthy meta-learning on a large dataset of videos, and after that is able\
      \ to frame few- and one-shot learning of neural talking head models of previously\
      \ unseen people as adversarial training problems with high capacity generators\
      \ and discriminators. Crucially, the system is able to initialize the parameters\
      \ of both the generator and the discriminator in a person-specific way, so that\
      \ training can be based on just a few images and done quickly [...]"

      quote: "Methods for reasoning under uncertainty are a key building block of accurate and reliable machine learning systems. Bayesian methods provide a general framework to quantify uncertainty. However, because of model misspecification and the use of approximate inference, Bayesian uncertainty estimates are often inaccurate —- for example, a 90% credible interval may not contain the true outcome 90% of the time. Here, we propose a simple procedure for calibrating any regression algorithm; when applied to Bayesian and probabilistic models, it is guaranteed to produce calibrated uncertainty estimates given enough data. Our procedure is inspired by Platt scaling and extends previous work on classification"

      description: ""
      quote: "Deep neural networks and decision trees operate on largely separate paradigms; typically, the former performs representation learning with pre-specified architectures, while the latter is characterised by learning hierarchies over pre-specified features with data-driven architectures. We unite the two via adaptive neural trees (ANTs), a model that incorporates representation learning into edges, routing functions and leaf nodes of a decision tree, along with a backpropagation-based training algorithm that <b>adaptively grows the architecture from primitive modules</b> (e.g., convolutional layers)."

    - title: "Invariant Information Distillation for Unsupervised Image Segmentation and Clustering"
      url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06653"
      type: "paper"
      category: "cv"
      lab: "University of Oxford"
      description: ""
      quote: "We present a new method that learns to segment and cluster images without labels of any kind. A simple loss based on information theory is used to extract meaningful representations directly from raw images. This is achieved by maximising mutual information of images known to be related by spatial proximity or randomized transformations, which distills their shared abstract content. Unlike much of the work in unsupervised deep learning, <b>our learned function outputs segmentation heatmaps and discrete classifications labels directly</b>, rather than embeddings that need further processing to be usable."

    - title: "Deep Clustering for Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features"
      url: "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.05520.pdf"
      type: "paper"
      category: "cv"
      lab: "Facebook Research"
      description: ""
      quote: "In this work, we present DeepCluster, a clustering method that jointly learns the parameters of a neural network and the cluster assignments of the resulting features. DeepCluster iterativel groups the features with a standard clustering algorithm, kmeans, and uses the subsequent assignments as supervision to update the weights of the network."

      url: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31mqB4yGgQY"
      type: "video"
      category: "theory"
      lab: "Crazymuse AI"
      description: "A short-ish video (about 13 minutes) that deals with the notion of distance between distributions. The author presents the problem first tackled by Monge and then resolved by Kantorovich. All of this is of course to introduce the Wasserstein distance and its use in  WGANs. Although the video is presented as an introduction to these notions, I found it quite hard to follow and would personally characterise it rather as an excellent <i>refresher</i> video."

    - title: "(KDD 2018) Rosetta: Large scale system for text detection and recognition in images"
      url: "http://www.kdd.org/kdd2018/accepted-papers/view/rosetta-large-scale-system-for-text-detection-and-recognition-in-images"
      type: "paper"
      category: "cv"
      lab: "Facebook AI"
      description: "In the video presenting this paper, the narrator states that Rosetta (the OCR method and pipeline presented here) is <i>designed to process images uploaded daily at Facebook scale</i>. Their method uses the faily common CTC loss with a ResNet architecture. Where it stands out however is that their approach is fully convolutional; in other words: they do not use explicitely any recurrent architectures (like LSTMs). This choice is explained in the paper: <i>The main argument is that recurrent models are slower at inference time, and a small loss in accuracy is affordable if the inference time is reduced.</i>. Besides, they propose a strategy to train their model whereby the training is first performed on small and simple words and is gradually increased to longer/harder words. They also provide the engineering details of the Rosetta pipeline."

      description: "An alternative to Mendeley? The main difference is that it's more of a DIY service. From my initial understanding, what they provide is a web interface to serve your library of papers. However, they do not host the said library (this being the list of papers and their associated PDF). For this, you will need to define your library in a Git repo and use Google Drive to store the PDFs. Also, the project is open-source! I will give it a try."

      category: "ml"
      lab: "Distill"
      description: "A new brilliant blog post from Distill. This one deals with image parameterization in the context of style transfer of image optimisation (when we optimise the input image to maximise the activation of certain neurons). A number of approaches are explored (conditioning the input on external images,  chaging the input space using FFT or a Compositional Pattern Producing Networks). The article has mostly been acclaimed for its exploration of texture-map generation for 3d objects. By incorporating the knowledge of UV map to the network, authors were able to generate convincing texture maps for given 3d objects. Similarly, they managed to perform style transfer in 3d! As usual with the Distill articles, prepare 30 to 40 minutes of reading time if you want to dig a little bit. Oh and if that wasn't enough,  they provide all the code they used directly in a Colab notebook, ready to be used!"

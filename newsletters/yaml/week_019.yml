      description: "You may have seen the presentation of Google Duplex during their IO conference (<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM>here</a>). It is in essence an extension to Google Assistant that is able to naturally interact with people over the phone to make bookings, ask for information etc. Highly recommend to watch the video. It's dope. Yet it's a live presentation and we can wonder 'have they really done that?'. This blogpost is here to (almost) prove it! It details the scenarios in which Google Duplex works and the ones where it doesn't. In particular, we learn that they use <i>specialised</i> algorithms for each use scenario. There will be one for flight bookings, another one for restaurant bookings etc. Also, although the core algorithm is using an RNN, they sometimes rely on less sophisticated methods yet more efficient. This is useful for cases where a low latency is critical to create the illusion of natural conversation (for instance when replying to 'hello?')."

      quote: " To support the development of learning-based pipelines for low-light image processing, we introduce a dataset of raw short-exposure low-light images, with corresponding long-exposure reference images. Using the presented dataset, we develop a pipeline for processing low-light images, based on end-to-end training of a fully-convolutional network. The network operates directly on raw sensor data and replaces much of the traditional image processing pipeline, which tends to perform poorly on such data."

      quote: "We propose ContextNet, a new deep neural network architecture which builds on factorized convolution, network compression and pyramid representations to produce competitive semantic segmentation in real-time with low memory requirements. ContextNet combines a deep branch at low resolution that captures global context information efficiently with a shallow branch that focuses on high-resolution segmentation details."

      description: ""
      quote: "In this work, we propose an alternative approach. We first observe that adversarial samples are much more sensitive to perturbations than normal samples. That is, if we impose random perturbations on a normal and an adversarial sample respectively, there is a significant difference between the ratio of label change due to the perturbations. Observing this, we design a statistical adversary detection algorithm called nMutant (inspired by mutation testing from software engineering community). Our experiments show that nMutant effectively detects most of the adversarial samples generated by recently proposed attacking methods."

      description: ""
      quote: "Deep learning (DL) defines a new data-driven programming paradigm where the internal system logic is largely shaped by the training data. The standard way of evaluating DL models is to examine their performance on a test dataset. The quality of the test dataset is of great importance to gain confidence of the trained models. Using inadequate test dataset, DL models that have achieved high test accuracy may still suffer from vulnerability against (adversarial) attacks. [...]  In this paper, we propose the mutation testing framework specialized for DL systems. We first propose a source-level mutation testing technique to slightly modify source (i.e., training data and training programs) of DL software, which shares the same spirit of traditional mutation testing. Then we design a set of model-level mutation testing operators that directly mutate on DL models without a training process."

    - title: "Predictive Uncertainty in Large Scale Classification using Dropout - Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo"

      type: "paper"
      category: "theory"
      lab: "Universidad Catolica del Maule"
      description: ""
      quote: "Predictive uncertainty is crucial for many computer vision tasks, from image classification to autonomous driving systems. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is an inference method for sampling complex posterior distributions. On the other hand, Dropout regularization has been proposed as an approximate model averaging technique that tends to improve generalization in large scale models such as deep neural networks. Although, HMC provides convergence guarantees for most standard Bayesian models, it does not handle discrete parameters arising from Dropout regularization. In this paper, we present a robust methodology for predictive uncertainty in large scale classification problems, based on Dropout and Stochastic Gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. "

      lab: "Pacific Northwest National Laboratory"
      description: ""
      quote: "In the current work we use the concept of mutual information between successive layers of a deep neural network to elucidate this mechanism and suggest possible ways of exploiting it to accelerate training. We show that adding structure to the neural network that enforces higher mutual information between layers speeds training and leads to more accurate results. High mutual information between layers implies that the effective number of free parameters is exponentially smaller than the raw number of tunable weights."

      quote: "In this paper, we focus on the task of video classification and aim to reduce the computational time by using the idea of distillation. Specifically, we first train a teacher network which looks at all the frames in a video and computes a representation for the video. We then train a student network whose objective is to process only a small fraction of the frames in the video and still produce a representation which is very close to the representation computed by the teacher network."

      description: "A nice find for me... Apparently they destroyed previous SOTA on video recongition."
      quote: "Both convolutional and recurrent operations are building blocks that process one local neighborhood at a time. In this paper, we present non-local operations as a generic family of building blocks for capturing long-range dependencies. Inspired by the classical non-local means method in computer vision, our non-local operation computes the response at a position as a weighted sum of the features at all positions. This building block can be plugged into many computer vision architectures."

      description: ""
      quote: "Knowledge distillation (KD) consists of transferring knowledge from one machine learning model (the teacher) to another (the student). Commonly, the teacher is a high-capacity model with formidable performance, while the student is more compact. By transferring knowledge, one hopes to benefit from the student's compactness. we desire a compact model with performance close to the teacher's. We study KD from a new perspective: rather than compressing models, we train students parameterized identically to their teachers. Surprisingly, these Born-Again Networks (BANs), outperform their teachers significantly, both on computer vision and language modeling tasks. Our experiments with BANs based on DenseNets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 (3.5%) and CIFAR-100 (15.5%) datasets, by validation error."

This interview is pretty high level. Pearl does not hide his skepticism towards machine learning and deep learning. He acknowledges that a surprisingly high number of problems were solved with machine learning, but the true way towards AI must incorporate the notion of cause and effect, not just correlations."

      quote: "Critical periods are phases in the early development of humans and animals during which experience can irreversibly affect the architecture of neuronal networks. In this work, we study the effects of visual stimulus deficits on the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs). [...] We use Fisher Information as a measure of the strength of the network's connections during the training. Our information-theoretic analysis suggests that the first few epochs are critical for the creation of strong connections across different layers, optimal for processing the input data distribution. Once such strong connections are created, they do not appear to change during additional training."

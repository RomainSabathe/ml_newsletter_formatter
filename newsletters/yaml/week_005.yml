    "Hey everyone, hope you had a good week. I'm trying a new structure
    which is content-based rather than format-based (where we separate
    blog posts and papers). What do think? prefer? If you have any
    suggestions please tell me,... the goal is to make this useful :-) I try to
    order the articles (within categories) by relevance. But then it is not so
    curated so maybe you don't know what to pick... I don't know... Give me
    suggestions!! What would you like?"

    "An introduction/presentation of a recent work from Twitter. They perform
    saliency detection (i.e. detection of the zones where the human eye is likely
    to attend) to choose which regions on an image should be cropped. Their main
    research deals with optimizing the inference time. Pruning  and knowledge
    distillation are at stake."

   type: Paper
   category: Deep Learning

   url:
   description:
    "Another paper that explores evolutionary algorithms to come up with powerful
    architectures and compares it to RL-based approaches.'Finally, we present new
    architectures discovered with evolution that we nickname AmoebaNets. These
    models set a new state of the art for CIFAR-10 (mean test error = 2.13%) and
    mobile-size ImageNet (top-5 accuracy = 92.1% with 5.06M parameters), and reach
    the current state of the art for ImageNet (top-5 accuracy = 96.2%).\n'

   lab: MIT
   url:
   description:
    "'We propose Object-Oriented Deep Learning, a novel computational paradigm of
    deep learning that adopts interpretable 'objects/symbols' as a basic
    representational atom instead of N-dimensional tensors (as in traditional
    'feature-oriented' deep learning).' -- The abstract makes me think about
    Capsules. But these are not capsules! In particular, they don't use any  CNNs.
    The graphs look a bit odd."

    "Finally, AR objects will remain still and robustly attached to the ground!
    Even when the objects move away/closer from the camera. Impressive gifs in this

   description: 
    "Quite hard to follow if you're not up to
    comfortable with variational inference but interesting nonetheless. He shows
    how the Fisher-Rao norm could be interesting as a criterion for pruning. The

    "Hey everyone, hope you had a good week. I'm trying a new structure
    which is content-based rather than format-based (where we separate
    blog posts and papers). What do think? prefer? If you have any
    suggestions please tell me,... the goal is to make this useful :-) I try to
    order the articles (within categories) by relevance. But then it is not so
    curated so maybe you don't know what to pick... I don't know... Give me
    suggestions!! What would you like?"

    saliency detection (i.e. detection of the zones where the human eye is likely
    to attend) to choose which regions on an image should be cropped. Their main
    research deals with optimizing the inference time. Pruning  and knowledge
    distillation are at stake."

	 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
     1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a
     type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
     into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
     popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem

    models set a new state of the art for CIFAR-10 (mean test error = 2.13%) and
    mobile-size ImageNet (top-5 accuracy = 92.1% with 5.06M parameters), and reach
    the current state of the art for ImageNet (top-5 accuracy = 96.2%).</br>'

    deep learning that adopts interpretable 'objects/symbols' as a basic
    representational atom instead of N-dimensional tensors (as in traditional
    'feature-oriented' deep learning).' -- The abstract makes me think about
    Capsules. But these are not capsules! In particular, they don't use any  CNNs.
